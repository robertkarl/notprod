DEV LOG ENTRY 2



Asked Suzy to look into our payment processor. Set her up with 
a copy of our production configuration: a single-core machine running
nginx, wsgi, and python.

Just think, we're one of the FAANGMS by market-cap, and this is how we collect
micropayments?

20% of our payment requests currently 500 because this machine can't handle
the load.

Hopefully the intern can figure it out.

Luckily we have high-quality backup-and-restore. LOLOL

In case I need to make another copy of this dev instance, here's the command:

  dd if=/dev/sda1 of=/dev/sda2 bs=4M

Remember to install a new SSD beforehand. ROFL
