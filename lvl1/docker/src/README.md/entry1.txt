Justin left today for another Big Tech Co. Right in the middle of our
payment processing debacle... People wearing suits keep coming by 
our open workspace, taking critical espresso-machine-line-space and asking
about revenue and stuff I don't care about.

Anyways. According to Justin if we could just configure WSGI (and it's
supposedly a 1-character change) we could increase revenue 25%? Who would 
have thought.


He kept talking about Etsy and Top but I have no idea why that's important.

It'll have to wait until after the ping-pong tourney though. Dev/ops has
a serious chance in the doubles spot, even though we'll never beat Zoran 
from sales in singles.
