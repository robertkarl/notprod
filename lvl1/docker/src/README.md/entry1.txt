SNOOG DEV LOG ENTRY 1



Justin left today for another Big Tech Co. Right in the middle of our
payment processing debacle... People wearing suits keep coming by
the cube, taking critical espresso-machine-line-space and asking
about revenue and shit I don't care about.

Anyways. According to Justin if we could just configure WSGI (More like WTFSGI
 amirite? hahaha.... I crack myself up) properyl we'd have a huge bottom-line win.

It's supposedly a 1-character change and we could increase revenue 25%? It's something straight
out of code golf. Who would have thought. As long as we can get QPS over 3 we're golden. His words.


He kept talking about Etsy and Top but I have no idea why second-hand goods are important.
And apparently, you can use `ps T` and `kill` with no flags to force a refresh on
the UWTFSGI config... but who has time for that. Just writing it all down since stuff he
says sometimes has its way of being really important. Not sure what we'll do without that guy around.

Justin wrote QPS tester and the payment processor, so I'm pretty sure they work well... it must just be
set up wrong. Maybe it's got the wrong endianness? Isn't stuff faster if you can byte-align it
by endianness? Damned if I know.

Anyways not digging into this today. I'm getting amped on espresso and practicing for the big tourney.
