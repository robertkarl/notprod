SNOOG DEV LOG ENTRY 1



Justin left today for another Big Tech Co. Right in the middle of our
payment processing debacle... People wearing suits keep coming by
our open workspace, taking critical espresso-machine-line-space and asking
about revenue and stuff I don't care about.

Anyways. According to Justin if we could just configure WSGI (More like WTFSGI
 amirite? hahaha.... I crack myself up).

It's supposedly a 1-character change and we could increase revenue 25%? Who would
have thought.

He kept talking about Etsy and Top but I have no idea why that's important.
And apparently, you can use `ps T` and `kill` with no flags to force a refresh on
the UWTFSGI config... but who has time for that. I'm getting amped on espresso
and practicing for the big tourney.
