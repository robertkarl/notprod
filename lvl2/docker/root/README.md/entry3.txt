TRANQ DEV LOG ENTRY 3



Brilliant move, management. Requiring man pages for every service deployed to
every production instance.  Straight outta Office Space.

First the new laundry service vendor stops their starch-and-fold service on
t-shirts, then they stopped serving CRUNCHY BACON alongside flimsy, flopsy
bacon? What a clown show. My second-edition Payment Hack Day Shirt, with the
overlaid P/P logo, is basically vintage at this point. How am I supposed to
keep taht looking fresh if the laundry service keeps degrading?

TODO: Create a man page for payment_processor. Start with 'man man'.
/usr/local/man should be writeable.
